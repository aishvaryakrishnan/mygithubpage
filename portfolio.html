The application for "Internal Security and Compliance Management" was developed using Java ServerFaces and Spring MVC Architecture focusing on the protection and management of data. The other assignment based on SmartGWT technology was developed for the commercial aviation domain, to manage large amounts of data for tens of thousands of users and efficiently handle file synchronization on a NAS system. This project was developed on Agile Methodology, which involved direct client interaction and live code discussions.</p>
